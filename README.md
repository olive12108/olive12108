- Hello, i'm Olivia (Olive), a 4th year student in Computer/Electrical Engineering Technology at RIT
- I'm mostly interested in working with Digital Logic and Embedded Systems
- My github is mostly for hosting school related projects and notes. My main languages are VHDL, C and C++ although i've dabbled in Verilog, Python and recently C# as well

- I hope to start using this place more to host all of my projects, code-related or otherwise.
